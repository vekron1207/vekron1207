## 🧠 Who Am I?

- A **coder** who writes code that **sometimes compiles**.
- Based in **New Delhi**, powered by **coffee and stack traces**.
- Once yelled “_It’s working!_” loud enough to scare a dog.  
- Still not sure if I’m a **Java developer who loves Python** or the other way around.

## 💻 Tech I Know

- Can explain Git in a way that **makes it sound like magic**.
- Wrote blockchain code once. Still not sure how it works.
- I speak fluent **Python, Java, and sarcasm**.
- Made friends with **PostgreSQL**. We talk **in joins** now.

## 🧪 Side Quests (Projects)

- **Authenti-Kator**: A blockchain thingy to stop fake products. Like Sherlock, but with code.
- **Medical Info System**: Helps doctors stop losing test results. You're welcome, humanity.

## 🛠 Superpowers

- Turning coffee into working apps ☕➡️💻  
- Copy-pasting from Stack Overflow like a pro 🧙  
- Debugging stuff I didn’t write 😤  
- Googling error messages **with deadly precision**

## 📡 Currently

- Exploring **cybersecurity** (yes, I *do* wear a hoodie sometimes).
- Learning **why my code worked yesterday but not today**.

## 🕹 Fun Fact

I thought I’d grow up to be a hacker in a dark room. Turns out I’m just a dev in a hoodie… in a slightly better-lit room.
